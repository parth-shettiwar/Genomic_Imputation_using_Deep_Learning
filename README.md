**Abstract**  
Genome imputation refers to the statistical inference of unobserved genotypes. It is an
import and and challenging problem in bioinformatics. Most of the previous solutions use statistical
methods like SVD to tackle this problem. In this work we frame the genome imputation problem as
a language generation task and leverage and train the existing deep learning approaches in an autoregressive fashion, to achieve superior results compared to previous approaches. We evaluate our models performance on R2 and accuracy metrics on 1000 Genomes dataset, followed by ablation studies.

Following table shows illustrates the superiority of our models over existing traditional machine learning algoirthms:
